# dollarshell
Basically a wrapper for your shell for those pesky commands prefixed with $ \\
If you're lazy like me, this command is useful. \\
No more manually removing the $ from commands from online.

## Requirements
- Python 3 with sys, os, and subprocess modules (should be installed by default)
- A shell.

## Installation
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hellscap3d/dollarshell/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Usage (including the $)
```bash
$ ls 
```
