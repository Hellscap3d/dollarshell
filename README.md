# dollarshell
Basically a wrapper for your shell for those pesky commands prefixed with $
If you're lazy like me, this command is useful.
No more manually removing the $ from commands from online!

## Installation
```bash
curl https://github.com/Hellscap3d/dollarshell/raw/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Usage (including the $)
```bash
$ ls 
```
